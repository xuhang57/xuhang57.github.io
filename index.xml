      <description>Building a great blog is a long-time commitment and it is not an easy one. It is difficult that you do not always know what you would want to write about. In addition, writing in English, which is not my native language, makes the posts not so clear and concise. I consider this is a learning process, which helps me become a better writer. And I also hope to become a better developer by writing my thoughts on coding and programming.</description>
