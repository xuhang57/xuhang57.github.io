<p>My name is Hang Xu and I usually go by Lucas. I am working as  a software engineer at <a href="https://massopen.cloud/">Mass Open Cloud</a> (MOC) at the moment.</p>

<p>I graduated from <a href="https://www.bu.edu/">Boston University</a> (BU) in May 2016 with a double major in Computer Science and Statistics. After I graduated, I started to work full-time at MOC. Besides programming and math, I also have a great passion about finance and economics. I hope this blog can give you a better sense about my passions since I believe they can be shown through more about your actions rather than your talking.</p>

<p>You can find on <a href="https://github.com/xuhang57">Github</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/8379419/lucas?tab=profile">Stack Overflow</a>.  I also check <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hangxulucas/">LinkedIn</a> from time to time. I use <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_Resources">JavaScript</a> on a daily basis and even so, it does not mean that I am an expert on both of these languages. I am still improving my understanding of them day by day.</p>

<p>Currently, I am refreshing my memory about <a href="https://java.com/en/">Java</a> since I have only learned it during my freshman year at BU. In addition, I am learning a new programming language called <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>. My interests are on full-stack web development and software engineering, which I know it sounds really vague. However, I am still exploring all different fields and expanding my horizon.</p>

<p>I like playing basketball after work.  Furthermore, I am very fortunate that I have been to many places within the U.S. such as Key Wests, LA, NYC, Bay Area, Seattle and some other cities outside U.S such as Sydney and Tokyo. Traveling around the world has opened my eyes to this world and I hope I take my footprints to more beautiful places in this world.</p>

<p>Another thing I do regularly is contributing code to open source projects. Here is a list of open source projects that I have contributed. I am working hard to grow this list and will update it accordingly.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/CCI-MOC/hil">HIL</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/CCI-MOC/giji-backend">GIJI</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openstack/horizon">Horizon</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cyverse/troposphere">Troposphere</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cyverse/atmosphere">Atmosphere</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cyverse/clank">Clank</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I like reading blogs and I have learned a lot from those excellent bloggers. I hope you can learn from them as well: <a href="https://lucashangxu.pw/en/other-blogs/">Blogs</a></p>
