      <description>Slow Down  Take some extra minutes to try to understand what FreeCodeCamp is trying to teach.
 Take extensive notes at the end of each challenge. It helps you retain the new knowledge.
  Do not Rely Solely on FreeCodeCamp to Learn New Concepts  Make it a habit to learn from other resources.
 You would want to become an expert at everything when learning how to code, not to know just the bare minimum to get a basic website up.</description>
