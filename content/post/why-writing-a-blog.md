I read posts on different blogs regularly. For example,

- [Coding Horror](http://blog.codinghorror.com/)
- [Home of Feross Aboukhadijeh » Feross.org](https://feross.org/)
- [Joel on Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/)

Building a great blog is a long-time commitment and it is not an easy one. It is difficult that you do not always know what you would want to write about. In addition, writing in English, which is not my native language, makes the posts not so clear and concise. I consider this is a learning process, which helps me become a better writer. And I also hope to become a better developer through writing what my thoughts on coding and programming. Even just sharing what I read about in other people’s posts should be able to help me go through the process. 

Another purpose of starting to write a blog is to show my passions. I believe that passion for certain things is not something you can prove to have unless you are really taking actions persistently. I will write my posts in either English or Mandarin and it depends on the content. Many times, I see some great posts written in English and I am thinking, should I translate that in Mandarin so I can share them with some developers in China who do not know English.

A great post on why you should start writing a blog today:
